# Interactive Sort
*Developed and tested on Ubuntu 20.04.2, with no current plans to support other operating systems.*
##
**Requirements to run**
* Python 3
* Kitty terminal
* ImageMagick

*Interactive Sort* uses Python's curses library to show you one image at a time in your terminal, and prompts you to press a key to move the image to the directory assigned to that key. You can add and remove keys by navigating through the menu.

I made this after looking around for a program that would do something in a similar way, and couldn't find one. The purpose of this program is to emphasize using a single keystroke after being shown an image to speed up the process of organizing images, and to avoid hassle of double clicking, or clicking-and-dragging.

#### Development

Contributions are welcome! This is the first draft of this program, rough but usable.
